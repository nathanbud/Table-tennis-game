# Table-tennis-game
Table tennis game using HTML5 canvas CSS and Javascript.

This is my first javascript game. The code was based from the Code Your First Game: Arcde Classic in Javascript on Canvas by Chris DeLeon. 

# The game
 - This is a single player game. You will be playing against the computer (red-bar-racket). You on the other hand, will be the white-bar-racket. Your aim is to return the white ball on the other side of the board/table.  
 
# Controls
A. Use your Mouse to bring up or down the bar. You can position your racket as to where the ball will hit to change the direction of the ball. 
 
# Scoring
- Any unreturned or miss will equate to 1 point for the opposing player.

# For improvements
 - Put levels ( Difficulty level)
